The "Stepladder" is a type of smoother approach. 

It is a tone downed version of NO PMO but in a different manner. 

I am trying this approach from 2 days and will keep you posted. 

In this approach we are trying to gradually reduce the use of porn and its dependency 

We are yet to identify the scientific basis and we will keep you posted. 

The approach is quite simple and straightforward. 

1. Refrain the use of videos. 
2. If you have any pictures or magazines try to stick to that. 
3. If you do today, give yourself a break of 2days and then do if you want.  
4. Keep giving the break in the multiples of 2. 
(Example: If you do it today. Do two days after day 0, if you want. 
Then if you do it again on day 2. give yourself a break of 4. 
If you do it on day 4 give yourself a break of 6 days and so on.) 
5. If you get any urges in the between, try making an analysis for your urge and then log it down. 
6. Focus on yourself and work on your hobbies and career. 

DOs and Dont's: 
1. Never ever look at videos.!!! 
2. Never look up your fetishes 
3. Never leave the emotional aspect of it. 
4. You can sext. 
5. You need to workout. 
6. Limit social media usage to 2hrs.

The approach tries to breakdown the dopamine 
addiction and tries to limit your dependency.
