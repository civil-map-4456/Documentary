All this stuff is just your temporary thing to escape the harsh reality of the world. 

Things that distract from the reality is nothing but similar drugs and it can be anything even the internet, mobile phone, etc. 

People should realise it before it eats you from inside out. 

People are fragile beings when compared to all the other animals on the planet. The only thing that really empowers is the brain and it plays a very good game in ruining our life when we need the most. 


Enough of this Shit post. I just want to vent out. So. 

Until next time.
